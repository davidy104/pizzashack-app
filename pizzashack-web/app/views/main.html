      <p>In 1959, Mary Fazio opened the original Shack, using her father’s recipes and her kitchen’s pots and pans.  She created a warm and cozy place where her friends and family gathered to enjoy her home-cooked meals.  She made everything from scratch, from pizza dough to soups, pasta sauces to salad dressings.  Mary’s Italian comfort food kept her friends coming back to the Shack again and again. Mary pioneered the “open kitchen” concept so she could greet each guest as they walked through the door, and keep an eye out to make sure that no one left hungry.

      This is the best pizza I have ever had! I came to visit my parents and we ordered take out from here. I was welcomed by two wonderful and sweet girls when picking up, and when we got home, I was AMAZED by the flavor!!! I am very disappointed this is not near me, or this would be a definite favorite.
